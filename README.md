Business Context:
There is a huge demand for refurbished cars in the Indian Market today. As sales of new cars have slowed down in the recent past, the refurbished car market has continued to grow over the past year and is larger than the new car market now. 

Consider this: In 2018-19, the sales of refurbished cars which were previously owned by someone has increased steadily, and it is currently estimated to be approximately 1.3 times the sales of new cars. There are multiple reasons for this shift. However, the key reason is the increase in total cost of ownership of new cars which includes taxes, insurances.

There is a slowdown in new car sales and that could mean that the demand is shifting towards the pre-owned market.
